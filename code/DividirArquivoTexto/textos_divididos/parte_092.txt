œand show her Ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.â€

Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,
Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
decent-looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

â€œHow could I ever think her like her nephew?â€ said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

â€œYou can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.â€

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

â€œIndeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.â€

â€œMiss Bennet,â€ replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, â€œyou ought to
know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you.â€

â€œIf you believed it impossible to be true,â€ said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, â€œI wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?â€

â€œAt once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.â€

â€œYour coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,â€ said Elizabeth
coolly, â€œwill be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.â€

â€œIf! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?â€

â€œI never heard that it was.â€

â€œAnd can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?â€

â€œI do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_
may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.â€

â€œThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?â€

â€œYour Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.â€

â€œIt ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in.â€

â€œIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.â€

â€œMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.â€

â€œBut you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this ever induce me to be explicit.â€

â€œLet me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?â€

â€œOnly this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.â€

Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--

â€œThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the
union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?â€

â€œYes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?â€

â€œBecause honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.â€

â€œThese are heavy misfortunes,â€ replied Elizabeth. â€œBut the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.â€

â€œObstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I
be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any personâ€™s
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.â€

â€œ_That_ will make your Ladyshipâ€™s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_.â€

â€œI will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the fatherâ€™s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,
connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall
not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.â€

â€œIn marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentlemanâ€™s daughter; so far we are
equal.â€

â€œTrue. You _are_ a gentlemanâ€™s daughter. But what was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine
